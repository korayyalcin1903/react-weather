 ## Api I use: https://www.weatherapi.com/
 
The weather website we created with React is an application that provides users with up-to-date weather information. React is a JavaScript library that is often preferred for developing modern web applications.

In your application, the weather information of the users' location is automatically retrieved and presented to the users. In addition, users can also search for the weather of different locations through the application.
